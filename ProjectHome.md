First of all, this is a re-implementation of a plugin named jqueryrotate (URL - http://code.google.com/p/jqueryrotate/).

The main idea behind this plugin is to provide smooth image zoom feature while rotating them in different angles and speed(or easing functions).

So it would seem, like a picture is coming from nowhere, while rotating and zooming itself to its maximum or limited zoom percentage.
